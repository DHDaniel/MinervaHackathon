## About 
### What is Minerva Hackathon?

At Minerva Hackathon, we believe that you can think and create bigger than most Hackathons expect from you. We encourage you to learn about the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) side by side with talented peers and outstanding mentors. Meet programmers, designers, and problem solvers to build projects together that are worth sharing because they matter for communities all over the world. Join us in a weekend-long problem-solving experience at GitHub HQ.

### What is this guide for?
This guide is meant to do just that - _guide you_ - throughout the hackathon. You'll find the schedule, frequently asked questions, useful resources, information on workshops and submissions, and a link to the SDG Knowledge Hub. If you're ever confused about what's going on, this guide should be your first go-to resource. If you're still confused, reach out to any of the volunteers or organizers that you see walking around!

## Before 
### Things to Know
1. **What should I bring?**
    
    You should bring your own laptop, charger and any devices that you think would be helpful in hacking (don‚Äôt worry, an MLH     hardware lab is also going to be present). Photo ID is required upon check-in. If you are staying overnight, make sure to     bring some clothes, toiletries and sleeping bag/blanket.
    
2. **Can I charge my electronics?**
    
    Outlet extensions will be strewn across the HQ for you to charge your laptops and other electronic devices. Please be mindful of these and make sure to share with other hackers.  

3. **Will I be fed?**
    
    Food and drinks will be provided to you by GitHub. Coffee will be provided throughout the Hackathon in the Kitchen area next to the lounge right after you pass the reception desk. Also, there will be water for you. Stay hydrated. 

4. **What if I don‚Äôt have a team?** 
    
    We got you. We‚Äôll provide sessions for team formation and ideation, so that you can form a team of up to 4 people. It is encouraged that you pair up with people who have different skills. According to our experience, diverse backgrounds generate creative projects!
    
  

## During 

### Team formation ü§ù

The team size is up to 4 people. Want to be a solo-hacker? Yes you can. 

Hackathon is a collaborative event and it's encouraged to meet new friends and team up with people. A team with diverse skillsets and background(Developer, Data Scientists, Designer, etc) will likely to have creavity projects. Therfore, we created two ways to help you find the team:

#### 1 Team Formation Spreadsheet
Go to this spreadsheet to post your name, interest, ideas, skills. Connect with people. This will be the hub for team formation. 
Questions for inspiration will be attached to the spreadsheet and teams can sign their members next to questions. If you want to work on your own question (which you are encouraged to!)

#### 2 Slack Channel #team_formation
Join Slack and check out the #find_team channel. Post about your ideas, skills or needs there! 
The 7 categories of SDGs have their own channels where you can find all 17 SDGs. Hint - mention SDGs you're interesred to find people having similar goals and work together. 

Lastly, don't forget you can just talk to people in person! Being open-minded to share your ideas, people will not likely to steal it.

### Ideation - SDGs Knowledge Hub üìï
We've crafted a GitHub guide that should help you get inspiration on your SDG projects. **We highly recommend reading this before starting to hack!** You'll find tons of useful information, from what exactly each SDG is concerned with to datasets and examples of past projects for inspiration. Find it [here](https://github.com/DHDaniel/MinervaHackathon/blob/master/knowledge_hub.md).


### Criteria üéñ
Criteria explain how we think a good project should be. Here's three criteria for Minerva Hackathon:
1. **Impact** (50%) 
`Impact score = scalability x solvability x neglectedness`
    - Scale ‚Äì if we solved the problem, how good would it be?
    - Solvability ‚Äì if we doubled the resources dedicated to solving this problem, what fraction of the problem would we expect to solve?
    - Neglectedness ‚Äì how many resources are already going towards solving this problem?
To sum up, the Impact score incentivice solutions that has a large sacle, feasible to sovle and is highly negelected.   
Why measurement in this why? Understand more in [this article](https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/)

2. **SDG Relevance** (20%)
    Is the solution related to the one of multiple UN's Sustainable Development Goals, and does the association strong? 

3. **Demo / Pitch** (30 %)
    Did the demo and the pitch appropriately complement the concept? We'll look at your tech implementation, design and user experience. 

### Prizes 
1. 400$ credite for the best use of [Paperspace](https://use.paperspace.com/gradient)

Rest of prize TBA.


### Submissions üì§ 
To submit your project, you'll go to our [**DevPost site**](https://minervahackathon.devpost.com/) and register there. On the day of the hackathon, submissions will open, letting you create a new project where you can add descriptions, links, screenshots, and many other things. The DevPost page should guide you through the whole process.

If you still have questions about submission, just call out one of the volunteers or organizers walking around. They'll know what to do. 

All hacking will end 12:00 PM, April 7. **And the deadline for DevPost submission is 11:00 AM, April 7. **

### Demo and Pitches üéâ
Once hacking ends, you'll demo your final project in front of the judges. This will take a "science fair" format, where judges will walk around listening to 3-minute elevator pitches from each team and ask any clarifying questions about the projects. 

After this first round, judges will select 6 teams that will then demo their amazing projects in front of all the hackers.
**Prepare to be blown away.**
