# Hacker Guide

## About 
### What is Minerva Hackathon?

At Minerva Hackathon, we believe that you can think and create bigger than most Hackathons expect from you. We encourage you to learn about the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) side by side with talented peers and outstanding mentors. Meet programmers, designers, and problem solvers to build projects together that are worth sharing because they matter for communities all over the world. Join us in a weekend-long problem-solving experience at GitHub HQ.

### What is this guide for?
This guide is meant to do just that - _guide you_ - throughout the hackathon. You'll find the schedule, frequently asked questions, useful resources, information on workshops and submissions, and a link to the SDG Knowledge Hub. If you're ever confused about what's going on, this guide should be your first go-to resource. If you're still confused, reach out to any of the volunteers or organizers that you see walking around!

## Before 
### Things to Know
1. **What should I bring?**
    
    You should bring your own laptop, charger and any devices that you think would be helpful in hacking (don‚Äôt worry, an MLH     hardware lab is also going to be present). Photo ID is required upon check-in. If you are staying overnight, make sure to     bring some clothes, toiletries and sleeping bag/blanket.
    
2. **Can I charge my electronics?**
    
    Outlet extensions will be strewn across the HQ for you to charge your laptops and other electronic devices. Please be mindful of these and make sure to share with other hackers.  

3. **Will I be fed?**
    
    Food and drinks will be provided to you by GitHub. Coffee will be provided throughout the Hackathon in the Kitchen area next to the lounge right after you pass the reception desk. Also, there will be water for you. Stay hydrated. 

4. **What if I don‚Äôt have a team?** 
    
    We got you. We‚Äôll provide sessions for team formation and ideation, so that you can form a team of up to 4 people. It is encouraged that you pair up with people who have different skills. According to our experience, diverse backgrounds generate creative projects!
    
5. **What are these workshops you speak of?**
    
    We have organized workshops for you to help your ideation process and facilitate you in coming up with innovative and sustainable solutions. 
    
    All workshops will be held at the Stage Area. If you would like more information,  you can either Slack or find the respective PoC about the workshops!

## During 

### Team formation ü§ù

Hackers are encouraged to work in teams during the event for better collaboration and cooperation. To make the process easier, we've used channels within the Slack workspace and a live spreadsheet to register your teams.

#### Slack 
The 7 categories of SDGs have their own channels where you can find all 17 SDGs. Questions for inspiration are pinned in each channel where you can communicate with people interested in similar goals and work together. 

If you want to work on your own question, you can use the ‚Äú#generated‚Äù channel to post it and get other individuals that might also be interested in it.

#### Spreadsheet
A live spreadsheet will be posted where you can insert your name under the 7 categories and 17 SDGs next to questions you want to work on. All team members can be signed on in the cells. 

Questions for inspiration will be attached to the spreadsheet and teams can sign their members next to questions. If you want to work on your own question (which you are encouraged to!), you can write it under the ‚Äúhacker submitted questions‚Äù list so that others might also tackle them, or reach out to you to help out.

### Submissions üì§ 
To submit your project, you'll go to our [**DevPost site**](https://minervahackathon.devpost.com/) and register there. On the day of the hackathon, submissions will open, letting you create a new project where you can add descriptions, links, screenshots, and many other things. The DevPost page should guide you through the whole process.

If you still have questions about submission, just call out one of the volunteers or organizers walking around. They'll know what to do. 

All hacking will end 12:00 PM, April 7. **And the deadline for DevPost submission is 11:00 AM, April 7. **

### Demo üéâ
Once hacking ends, you'll demo your group project in front of the judges. This will take a "science fair" format, where judges will walk around listening to 3-minute elevator pitches from each team and ask any clarifying questions about the projects. 

After this first round, judges will select 6 teams that will then demo their amazing projects in front of all the hackers.
**Prepare to be blown away.**
